"""SIGKILL any process left in this systemd unit's cgroup.

Runs as ``ExecStopPost=`` so it only fires after the gateway's main process
has exited. The gateway already reaps its own tool subprocesses on a clean
shutdown; this is the safety net for long-lived helpers it doesn't track
(``adb``, platform bridges, etc.) that would otherwise be orphaned in the
cgroup and block ``Restart=always`` — issue #37454.

We deliberately iterate ``cgroup.procs`` and send per-PID SIGKILLs instead
of writing ``1`` to ``cgroup.kill``: the original failure mode in #37454
was the kernel returning ``EINVAL`` on the cgroup-wide kill, while per-PID
signal delivery uses a separate code path that still works.
